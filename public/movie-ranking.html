<h1>Great Movies</h1>
<p>
  One of the gifts a movie lover can give another is the title of a wonderful
  film they have not yet discovered. Here are more than 300 reconsiderations and
  appreciations of movies from the distant past to the recent past, all of
  movies that I consider worthy of being called "great." - Roger Ebert
</p>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Pledge</h3>
<p>
  Jerry is angered at the poor preservation of the crime scene, and at the
  general reluctance of the cops to notify the girl's parents. Hell with it.
  He'll do it himself. We see him slowly approach them across a floor covered
  with agitated turkey chicks. Penn holds his camera at a distance as Jerry
  breaks the news to the parents, whose anguish is apparent. Later, inside their
  house, he reassures them the killer will be found. The mother (Patricia
  Clarkson) holds up a crucifix made by her daughter, and asks for his solemn
  pledge. He gives it. He will not rest until then.
</p>

<p>
  The scene plays exactly like that. But later, thinking back to it, perhaps we
  sense a deeper level. Jerry Black is twice-divorced, childless, a career cop
  who now allegedly looks forward to spending the rest of his life fishing. But
  he was drawn to the news of the murder, drawn to the crime scene, drawn to be
  the one who informs the parents, and now he vows to solve the crime. What
  happened to his fishing trip? This is a man who is holding onto his identity
  with a desperate grip.

<h3>25th Hour</h3>

<p>
  Tomorrow morning, Monty Brogan is turning himself in to begin a prison term.
  His two best friends lean on a railing , look out over the river, and agree
  "it's over." They will never see Monty again. He may be alive in eight years,
  but he won't be the Monty they've known since they were kids. Monty Brogan
  also knows this. So do his girlfriend and his father. It will all end after
  tonight.
</p>

<p>
  Monty's mind is very concentrated. There is a sense, in Spike Lee's "25th
  Hour" (2002), that he's experiencing his last day of freedom in a heightened
  state. Everything is more focused, more meaningful, sometimes dreamy. He has
  his ideas about how he got here and who may have been involved, but there is
  little he can do about that now. From the choices still open to him, he
  focuses now on the remaining important things: His woman, his father, his
  friends, and unsettled business.
</p>

<h3>Adaptation</h3>
<p>
  There is also the sense that to some degree it's true: that it records the
  torments of a screenwriter who doesn't know how the hell to write a movie
  about orchids. And it has the audacity to introduce characters we know are
  based on real people and has them do shocking things.
</p>

<p>
  Even the DVD maintains the illusion of life colliding with art. The case
  contains a Columbia interoffice memo, seemingly included by accident, not even
  referring to this movie. And it is startling to see an ant crawling across the
  main menu until you get to the dialogue line, "I wish I were an ant."
