<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hey there, I'm Haritha! For the past three years, I've been the Sherlock
  Holmes of the tech world, hunting down bugs and ensuring software perfection
  as a QA professional. But now, I'm ready to swap my magnifying glass for a
  keyboard and dive headfirst into the world of development. Coding has become
  my new playground, and I'm having a blast building, breaking, and rebuilding
  until I get it just right.

  Why the shift, you ask? Well, coding is like solving a puzzle, and I've always
  loved a good challenge. There's something magical about seeing lines of code
  transform into functional and innovative solutions. I'm constantly learning
  new languages and technologies, and every day feels like an adventure in the
  vast universe of development. This new path is electrifying, and I can't wait
  to create something amazing.

  When I'm not in front of a computer screen, you'll find me on the tennis
  court, or behind a camera, capturing the world's beauty one snapshot at a
  time. I'm also a travel enthusiast, always on the lookout for the next
  exciting destination to explore. These hobbies keep me energized, inspired,
  and ready to take on any coding challenge that comes my way.
